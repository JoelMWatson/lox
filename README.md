# lox

This repository holds the code for the compilers I am writing for the small language "lox" following along with the book Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom.

The first compiler (cslox) is implemented in C# (rather than Java used in the book)

The second compiler (clox) is implemented in C (same as the book)
